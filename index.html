                <h3>Sunday August 11, 2013</h3>
                <p><em>Summary:</em> We listened to the first 4 tracks from PCRV – Note to Self. We talked about the je ne sais quoi or mouthfeel, or generalized swagg of older synthesis techniques, improvising or not improvising with no-input mixing boards, generally went “yeah that was pretty awesome,” and talked about structural tropes in experimental and noise music.
We listened to two electronic pieces by Brian Sevedge that he made especially for our meeting. We talked about making music with your phone, the incorporation of written narratives, someone complimented something as 'stupid', musicalizing digital artifacts for fun and profit, chorales, self-critiquing forms, sectionalized micro-variational forms (what), injuring yourself with sports equipment.
We listened to a 'prototype' of an electroacoustic piece by Paul Feyertag. We talked about concatenative synthesis, Slayer!, field recording, bounced around a few thoughts on spoken word, possible improvements and modifications that could be made to the piece, mobile forms, bowing microphones. We also listened an acoustic guitar improv of Paul's, and we talked about 'directedness', formal diffuseness, funk guitar riffs, stuff sounding like stuff that it isn't, what good duration iz good what good what duration iz?, Derek Bailey, and what does being 'experimental' mean anyway? ptthrp
We listened to 'D Song' by Nomad Palace & He Can Jog. We talked about teensy bell sounds, a lot on the dynamic between NP&HCJ during the recording and the continuous doubling of 'roles', said 'nice' a lot, slowly moving forms, and then again, what are we doing here?
