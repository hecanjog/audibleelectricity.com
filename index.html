                <h3>Sunday August 11, 2013</h3>
                <p><em>Summary:</em> We listened to the first four tracks from PCRV â€“ Note to Self. We talked about the general 'quality' that older synthesis techniques can lend to a piece; the challenges of improvising with no-input mixing boards, especially in regards to finding interesting, stable sounds; and structural tropes in experimental and noise music, e.g., a build-up to a golden ratio climax with a coda.
We listened to two electronic pieces by Brian Sevedge that he put together especially for our meeting, which is something that we most definitely encourage. We talked about making music with your phone; incorporating written narratives, in this case, someone hitting themselves in the face with a basketball and then crying; lo-fi audio and using digital artifacts; form as analysis, in this case, writing something on a typewriter, then incorporating both the text and the sound of that typewriter; and, ahem, 'sectionalized micro-variational structures.'
We listened to a prototype of an electroacoustic piece by Paul Feyertag. We talked about concatenative synthesis using corpuses made from samples of Slayer (SLAYAAA!), classical guitars, and bowed microphones; how using saturated textures with spoken word can have the effect of drawing the listener in in an attempt to understand what is going on and what is being said; structure as a series of cross-sections of simultaneous linear processes; possible routes for expansion and improvement of the piece, including mobile forms directed by accumulating and analyzing performance data. We also listened to an acoustic guitar improv of Paul's, and we talked about directivity <--> diffusivity as a formal exploit, funk guitar riffs; stuff sounding like stuff it isn't, and how that's a neat thing; Derek Bailey; how much does duration matter; and how long should long things be, e.g., if you have a long drone does say, 24 vs. 22 minutes matter?
We listened to 'D Song' by Nomad Palace &amp; He Can Jog. We talked about the role each had during the performance; in this case the texture of the piece was clearly segmented into two parts: melody, and a slowly developing, very 'activated' drone accompaniment. Both musicians participated in both textural layers, developing each layer simultaneously. It was mentioned that this was probably a lot more fun then say, cleanly dividing up roles between people.
