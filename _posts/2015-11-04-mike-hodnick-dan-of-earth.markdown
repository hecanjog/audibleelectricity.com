## Kindohm

[Mike Hodnick][mike] AKA Kindohm is an independent software developer and electronic music producer. 
He strives for unique and risky live performances through the use of live-coding and (often) 
improvisation, and enjoys exploring the extreme minimalism and complexity in static, 
algorithmic compositions.

## Dan of Earth

Dan of Earth will be performing a set with his now-infamous Bibletron synths -- [homebrew 
synths built into Gideon bibles.][bible]
