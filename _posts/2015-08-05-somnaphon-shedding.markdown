## Shedding

[Shedding][shedding] is the solo project of Connor Bell from Louisville. His latest album 
[Plod & PLay Vol.1][ppv1] is available for download now.

> “School teacher by day and architect of angular space sounds by night Connor Bell has politely offered his vision of hi-fi (read: it doesn’t sound recorded under water) bedroom pop under the moniker of Shedding for just under a decade. In that time, Shedding has shifted in and out of sonic consciousness, toggling between the type of meditative ambience that earns high marks amongst the Hecker School graduates– such as his 2010 release on Hometapes Tear in the Sun– and a hook-heavy psychedelic amalgam of resonant synths and acoustic noodling. Bell’s latest, Demography, falls clearly within the latter, but with an acute eye toward the mathematical rat race of the Autobahn this go round.” – Kenny Bloggins/TheDecibelTolls
