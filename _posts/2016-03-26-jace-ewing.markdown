## Jace Ewing

![Jace Ewing](/images/jace.ewing.jpg)

Jace Ewing's debut album "Simple System" is availble now via Crazy Iris Records. The label describes it as "experiments with homebrew 
software for generating/transforming melodic patterns. Mathematical purity is mixed with loose improvisation, resulting 
in a distinctively casual brand of formalism."

Last year also saw the release of a collaborative algorithmic video for The Waterclock with Garbage Pail Kids creator John Pound.

Travis Hallenbeck's MIDI User's Group project combines modern approaches with new and obsolete hardware to create a dynamic soup 
of algorithmic and improvisational machine dances.

Below is a live recording from a 2014 performance at the Electric Maid in Baltimore.
