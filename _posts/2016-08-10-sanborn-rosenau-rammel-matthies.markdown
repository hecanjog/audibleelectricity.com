## Rosenau/Sanborn

![Rosenau/Sanborn](/images/rosenau-sanborn.jpg)

Multi-instrumentalists Chris Rosenau (Collections of Colonies of Bees, Volcano Choir) and Nick Sanborn (Made of Oak, Sylvan Esso) 
are presenting a special set before heading off to the Eaux Claries festival in Eau Claire Wisconsin.

Rosenau's dense swirling loops of guitar and textures will gently lift your brain out of your skull, toss it around the room and 
abruptly collide into strategically placed walls of organic beats, rhythms, drones and granular artifacts custom built by Sanborn.
